Why We Use Spring? 


In the early 2000s, web development primarily relied on technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Similarly, before the advent of modern programming languages like , Python, and C++, many developers 
used C as the foundational language for software development. The evolution of these technologies has 
led to the emergence of frameworks such as ReactJS and Next.js for web development, which simplify 
complex tasks and enhance productivity. Before the introduction of Spring, Java developers primarily
relied on Java EE (Enterprise Edition) for building enterprise applications. However, Java EE was often 
cumbersome and complex, making it challenging for developers to create robust applications efficiently. 
Building server-side logic required significant time and effort,leading to frustration among developers.
Recognizing these challenges, Rod Johnson developed the Spring Framework to provide a more straightforward 
and efficient way to build Java applications. Spring simplifies application development by offering lightweight 
framework that promotes good programming practices and allows developers to focus on writing business logic rather 
than dealing with intricate configurations.With Spring, developers can quickly set up a server and implement complex 
business logic with minimal effort. 



Core Features of Spring:


One of the primary features that Spring offers is Inversion of Control (IoC). This principle allows for the creation of 
objects within a class while enabling access to those instances through Dependency Injection (DI). While it may sound simple,
accessing instances of one class from another can be quite challenging in traditional programming. This is a critical issue that
Spring effectively resolves.



Inversion of Control (IoC): This design principle shifts the responsibility of managing object creation from the application code 
to the Spring container. This means that instead of classes creating their dependencies, they receive them from the Spring IoC container.



Dependency Injection (DI): DI is a specific implementation of IoC where an objectâ€™s dependencies are provided externally rather 
than being created internally.This promotes loose coupling between classes and enhances testability.



By leveraging IoC and DI, Spring allows developers to manage complex dependencies easily, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code. 
As a result, developers can focus on building robust applications without getting bogged down by intricate object management issues.
