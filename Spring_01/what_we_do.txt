// ioc using applicationContext and Di Using xml



Spring application, you can control the creation of objects (or "beans") using an XML configuration file instead of writing code to manually create instances. This means that you don't need to use new to create objects of Car or Bus. Instead, Spring does it for you based on the configuration in applicationContext.xml.

Example:

To create an object of Bus:

xml
<bean id="bus" class="com.example.Bus"/>

To create an object of Car:

xml
<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car"/>

Key Benefit:
If you need to change the type of object being created (e.g., switch from Bus to Car), you only need to update the XML configuration. There is no need to modify your source code, which makes your application more flexible and easier to maintain.
